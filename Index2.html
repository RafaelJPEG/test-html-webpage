            The potato is a starchy vegetable native to the Americas, specifically southern Peru and
            northwestern Bolivia. <u><b>domesticated around 7,000–10,000 years ago.</b></u> 
            The Spanish introduced potatoes to Europe in the 16th century. Today, potatoes are a staple food worldwide,
            with over 5,000 varieties.
            They are especially important in Europe and Asia, with China and India leading in production.
            Potatoes belong to the nightshade family, and while they are generally safe to eat, they can become toxic if
            exposed to light, especially in the sprouts and skins.</i>

            <b><h2>Etymology</h2></b>
                <ul>
                    <li>The word "potato" comes from the Spanish "patata," which originated from the Taíno word "batata" meaning "sweet potato."<br>
                        The term "spud" for potato comes from the 15th-century word "spudde," meaning a short knife, and was later applied to the potato due to its shape.<br>
                        In several languages, including Afrikaans, Dutch, and French, the word for potato means "earth apple," referring to its apple-like shape.

            <b><h2>Description</h2></b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potato plants grow up to 1 meter tall with hairy stems and insect-pollinated flowers.<br>
                        They form tubers, which are thickened stems with "eyes" and breathing holes.<br>
                        After flowering, they produce small green fruits with seeds.
